# Brainstorming Document for Coding/Development Best Practices
Please add! I added some random things to start.
- use jsonargparse for all the configuration
- always log when you write a file
- static typing
- linting, unit testing, integration tests in CI/CD
- Args: style doc strings
- use pandera if you are using dataframes
- All the python pep 8 etc stuff
