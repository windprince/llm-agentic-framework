This contains code for the crop type transfer learning collaboration with Yi-Chia Chang

It ended up mostly being about downloading the Sentinel-2 images, since torchgeo is
used for the actual training. The process of obtaining Sentinel-2 images is documented
by a separate README in `sentinel2_images` folder.
