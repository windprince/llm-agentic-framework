This contains code built on top of rslearn for the Minderoo global fishing capacity
estimation project.

Currently this is limited to training the classification model that is run after the
object detector to refine the predictions.

All of the Minderoo code should be moved together into a single repository for release
to Minderoo, so this is not expected to exist here after 2024-11-01.
